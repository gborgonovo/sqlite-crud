A very simple crud interface for a sqlite DB

It needs Smarty Template engine (https://www.smarty.net/) to work correctly.

It works better with phpLiteAdmin (https://www.phpliteadmin.org/).

sqlitedit provides a very simple basic CRUD interface to SQLite DB. It is based on PDO so maybe it works with other DB as well.

You must set up a little bit the config file sqlitedit.config.php file with DB file name and structure, admin password, etc.

I have done it for myself, I'm glad if it can be useful for you too.
If you have any comment or want to improve it, please, let me know.
